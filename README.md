# MealPlannerWebsite
The Meal Planner Application 'OneStopGo' is a full-stack web application designed to simplify meal management and promote healthy eating habits. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the application offers users an intuitive platform to explore, create, and manage recipes tailored to various dietary preferences and categories. 

Users can register and log in to personalize their experience, add new recipes with detailed descriptions and images, and browse recipes filtered by specific categories such as diabetes-friendly, PCOS diets, or workout meals. The platform also includes a "Contact Us" feature to collect user feedback, connected to a database to securely store user-submitted inquiries for efficient management. 

Additionally, features such as expandable recipe details and recipe deletion functionality enhance the usability and interactivity of the application. This project combines front-end aesthetics with back-end functionality to deliver a responsive user experience, aiming to encourage better dietary planning and community engagement through shared recipes.
